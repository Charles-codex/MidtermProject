        <h3> What is nanotechnology?</h3>
        <p>The basic definition of nanotechnology is the changing and controlling of matter at the nano scale level with dimensions typically between 1 and 100 nanometers.</p>
        <p>Nanotechnology has been around for a long time but only recently have companies realized how they can use it to their advantage.</p>
        <p>There are examples of nanotechnology all around us. Smartphones that we use everyday have nanotechnology inside of them that make them work. Laptops have a lot of nanotechnology inside them. These are both things that we rely on every day as we go through our life.</p>

        <h3>The future of nanotechnology</h3>
        <p>Nanotechnology is ever becoming more popular as time goes on. With technology manufacturers are able to make things much stronger and more resilient to the elements. As time goes on more and more of this technology will be included in things like airplanes, cars, and so much more. Things that we rely on everyday will be filled with nanotechnology.</p>
        <p>The future for nanotechnology is bright. There are many oppurtunities for advancement. It can be used to make many peoples' lives easier, and I believe that as we progress through time it will become a popular type of technology for how strong and resilient it is.</p>
