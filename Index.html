    <p> What exactly is nanotechnology? What impact will it have on the present and the future? How will nanotechnology be used
        to change the world as we know it?
    </p>
    <p>
        These questions are ones that not everyone will think about, as nanotechnology is not seen to the human eye.
        To realize how powerful nanotechnology can be, we must think small.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website was designed to inform the general public on how important nanotechnology is and the impact it will have on our future as a human race.
